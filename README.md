- 👋 Hi everyone! I’m @elysemontano
- 👩‍💻 I am a Lead Instructor at LEARN Academy where I get to teach web development to the next generation of amazing coders! I have a passion for working with others, encouraging them to grow, for coding (because you know, it is pretty cool!), and solving puzzles.
- 🎤 With a six year background in live sound engineering, I am no stranger to troubleshooting, thinking outside the box, and working creatively and collaboratively to solve problems.  I am always looking to expand myself, further build my skills and bring the latest and most up to date approaches to my daily workflow.  
- 🚗 My journey into coding started at the end of 2020 when I decided to continue my education beyond Media Communications by joining several developer training websites.  Shortly thereafter I enrolled in LEARN Academy and began strengthening my skills as a developer utilizing the most up to date and commonly used languages, frameworks and other developer tools.
- 🌱 I currently have the amazing opportunity to teach at the same bootcamp I went to where I can share the knowledge and joy of coding with others.
- 📚 At LEARN Academy, I learned web development specifically in the tech stack of Ruby on Rails and React and have explored other languages such as PHP and C++ (not extensively though...)
- 📫 My portfolio can be found at https://elysemontano.com to read more about me and the projects I have worked on!
