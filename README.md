- 👋 Hi everyone! I’m @elysemontano
- 👩‍💻 I am a software developer with a passion for writing software and web applications, with readable code for efficient collaboration and a user friendly experience.  
- 🎤 With a six year background in live sound engineering, I am no stranger to troubleshooting, thinking outside the box, and working creatively and collaboratively to solve problems and produce a high quality standard.  I am always looking to expand myself, further build my skills and bring the latest and most up to date approaches to any project.  
- 🚗 My journey into coding started last year when I decided to continue my education beyond Media Communications by joining several developer training websites.  Shortly thereafter I enrolled in LEARN Academy and began strengthening my skills as a developer utilizing the most up to date and commonly used languages, frameworks and other developer tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science and have completed LEARN Academy's coding bootcamp
- 📚 The tech stack I am most familiar with is React and Ruby on Rails, however I am digging into C++ currently.
- 📫 My portfolio can be found at https://elysemontano.bss.design/ to read more about me and the projects I have worked on!
